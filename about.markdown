Timea Balogh is a Hungarian-American writer and translator with an MFA in Creative Writing
from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Originally from Budapest, she returned to her
beloved city in 2018 to study literary translation at the Balassi Institute. Timea published more
than thirty works in reputable American and international magazines over just two years. She is
soon to be a resident at The MacDowell Colony and the Vermont Studio Center. At the moment,
she is working on her first book, a collection of primarily magical realism that centers the stories
of Hungarian and Hungarian-American women, many of whom are immigrants, some of whom
are queer, but all of whom are grappling in some way to accept themselves, their identities,
cultures, and families.
